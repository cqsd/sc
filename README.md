## installation
cba with convention. just alias `sc` to `./base`.

## writing new modules/commands
see `./modules/meta` for example layout. use `meta create-command` for
convenience.

## autocomplete
`fish` completions can be generated with `sc meta generate-fish-completions`.
cuz u potentially need to regenerate them fairly often, there's a convenience
script to update them in the default location:
```
$ sc meta update-fish-completions
[+] writing new completions to /Users/example/.config/fish/completions/sc.fish
[+] done
```

they'll be available after you reload the shell:
```
$ sc[TAB]
meta  (setup, search, edit, etc.)  example  (module description)

$ sc meta[TAB]
create-module                         (create a new module)
edit                             (edit source for a module)
generate-fish-completions  (generate fish completions file)
search                    (search for a command by keyword)
â€¦and 4 more rows
```

`fish` completions need to be regenerated whenever you add/edit modules.

## todo
`zsh` completions are planned
